# Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Model and Its Applications

This project analyzes the dynamics of SGD using Volterra integral equations, numerical simulation, and various experimental settings.

## Topics Covered
- Analytical and numerical solutions to Volterra equations for SGD
- Effect of batch size on SGD convergence
- Online SGD (streaming data)
- Application to ridge regression

## Key Findings
- Volterra equation approximates SGD dynamics well for small step sizes
- Larger batch sizes lead to faster convergence
- Online SGD converges slower but still effective
